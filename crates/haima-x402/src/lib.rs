//! x402 protocol integration for Haima.
//!
//! Implements the x402 payment protocol at the HTTP layer:
//! - **Client middleware**: Intercepts HTTP 402 responses, parses payment terms,
//!   signs payments with the agent's wallet, and retries requests.
//! - **Server middleware**: Protects API routes with payment requirements,
//!   verifies incoming payments, and settles on-chain via a facilitator.
//! - **Facilitator client**: Communicates with Coinbase CDP (default) or
//!   self-hosted facilitators for payment verification and settlement.
//!
//! # Protocol Flow (Client)
//!
//! ```text
//! HTTP Request -> 402 + PAYMENT-REQUIRED header
//!   -> Parse PaymentRequired terms
//!   -> Evaluate against PaymentPolicy (auto-approve / require approval / deny)
//!   -> Sign with WalletBackend (message signing)
//!   -> Retry with PAYMENT-SIGNATURE header
//!   -> Receive 200 + PAYMENT-RESPONSE header (settlement confirmation)
//! ```
