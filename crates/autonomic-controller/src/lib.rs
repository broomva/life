//! Pure rule engine and projection reducer for the Autonomic homeostasis controller.
//!
//! This crate has no I/O dependencies. It provides:
//! - A deterministic projection reducer that folds events into `HomeostaticState`
//! - A rule engine that evaluates homeostatic rules against state
//! - Concrete rule implementations for economic, cognitive, and operational regulation
